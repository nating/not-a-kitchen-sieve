A graphical representation of how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works. One of the first programs I wrote in my first year of Computer Science.

##Overview
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple and efficient algorithm for finding small prime numbers. The user of the program can specify what number, N, they want all the primes beneath. Multiples of 1,2,3...âˆšN are marked as not prime. Afterwards, all the non-marked numbers are known to be prime. This program makes use of the Standard Drawing Library, StdDraw.java.
