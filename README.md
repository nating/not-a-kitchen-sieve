2️⃣3️⃣ A graphical Sieve of Eratosthenes. 5️⃣7️⃣

##Overview
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple and efficient algorithm for finding small prime numbers. The user of the program can specify what number, N, they want all the primes beneath. Multiples of 1,2,3... \sqrt{N} are marked as not prime. Afterwards, all the non-marked numbers are known to be prime. This program makes use of the Standard Drawing Library, StdDraw.java.
